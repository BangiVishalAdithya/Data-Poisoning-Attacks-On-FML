# Data Poisoning Attacks On FML

## Overview
This repository contains resources related to data poisoning attacks on federated machine learning (FML). Data poisoning attacks are a type of adversarial attack where an attacker intentionally manipulates training data to degrade the performance of machine learning models. In the context of federated machine learning, where models are trained across multiple decentralized clients, data poisoning attacks pose significant threats to the integrity and security of the learning process.
